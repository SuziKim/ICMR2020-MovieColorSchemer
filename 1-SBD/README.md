Semi-master-shot Boundary Detector (SBD)
---

# Description

This SBD is originated from the Imagelab Shot Detector (ILSD).

We slightly modified 'main.cpp' to achieve two functionalities:
  - making ILSD get two additional parameters: ![T](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T) and ![T^\ast_s](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T^\ast_s).
  - generating a subtitle file (.srt) to check the segmentation results visually.

In README-ILSD.txt, you can find the original guide for the ILSD usage.
